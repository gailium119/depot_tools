      "message": "I\u0027m a little conflicted on this change but I am not a git cl split user either. I like the idea of people being sure they want the specific split but we\u0027re adding friction where I haven\u0027t seen a _ton_ of complaints on the existing behavior either.\n\nI\u0027d like the opinion of some of the other depot_tools OWNERS (or Chromies at large). People can always use dry run if they want to check the split (my other idea was maybe gate this on a new flag, something like -i(nteractive), on par with other linux commands but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s quite the standard interactive behavior and dry run should be sufficient). \n\nEither way I think the improvements in printing the split could be useful. I could be convinced to take this patch though if others are supportive.",
