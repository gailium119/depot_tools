If not, then there might be other culprits and further investigation would be necessary.\n\nIf this drops the occurrence rate dramatically, but still happens once in a while, we\u0027d probably want to implement a read-write lock in lockfile.py.\n\nLet\u0027s land this CL first and then see if this resolves the ChromeOS build failures.",
