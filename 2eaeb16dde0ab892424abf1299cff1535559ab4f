Pylint by default searches the cwd for pylintrc. There\u0027s nothing that needs to be done to make it support that, other than not actively preventing it from doing so, as was happening when passing --rcfile.\n\n\u003e i\u0027m not saying you need it here, it\u0027s just that the commit message makes it sound like you\u0027re addressing that when you\u0027re only making it handle env vars.\n\nI don\u0027t think of this as \"making it handle env vars\", but \"switching it to using env vars\", and getting rid of the overly aggressive use of \"--rcfile\", which was preventing env vars and everything else from working. Does that make more sense?",
