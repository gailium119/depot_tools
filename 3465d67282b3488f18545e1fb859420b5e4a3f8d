      "message": "I don\u0027t know that I necessarily agree that this is more straightforward given the complexity you highlighted it introducing downstream.\n\nI agree totally that specific error messages are more clear, especially when there is complexity or conditions. In this case, I think it\u0027s pretty straightforward thoughth, because we only allow one thing.\n\nIMO it is very clear what the issue is if the error was to say something like \"Only commas are allowed as license separators. Using any other delimiter will result in an error. Each entry should be separated by a aingle comma only. If you have multiple licenses..etc\"",
