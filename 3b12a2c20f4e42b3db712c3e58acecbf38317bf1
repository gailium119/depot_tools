I see that you set the default param value for `verbose` in any other functions with `False`, and I believe that it\u0027s to keep the existing behaviour.

And in our official recipes, we\u0027ll actually set verbose\u003dtrue.\nEven though during the outage we only needed verbose logging for that one call, but it may be benefitially just give that option to other methods for the future.\n\nHopefully this helps :D)",

My question is, why does this CL sets the default verbose param value for this particular function, `get_changes()`?  If there is a reason, can you describe why? \n\nThe description states that \"get_changes() is **already** using verbose logging\", but it doesn\u0027t look like it was already using verbose, and I\u0027m asking the reason for the existing behaviour change.",

In order to keep behavior the same, I had to set it to `False` in all functions except `get_changes` (and the caller functions), but to `True` for `get_changes`, so that `--verbose` flag is still passed and there is no changes in the code using the current version of this module.\n\nIt is also reflected in the expectation file diffs: the `--verbose` flag was passed before these changes for the `get_changes` functions, and it\u0027s still passed after the changes, just at a different position, because now we are adding it last.\n\nPlease let me know if it makes more sense now :)",
