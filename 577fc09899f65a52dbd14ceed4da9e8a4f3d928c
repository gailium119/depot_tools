      "message": "While working on implementing sokcevic@\u0027s suggestion about the name of the \"Directories\" field, I discovered that the uploading algorithm uses the list of directories to name the branches that it uploads, which seems like a fundamentally flawed approach due to nondeterminism. This should address that and also make future changes easier.",

      "message": "`hash` returns a signed integer, and probably not the best to be used. It may also be hard to track it if someone runs split twice for whatever reason. Perhaps just using abs(hash(...)) will do the trick.\n\nOnce nice thing about the current implementation is that a user can assume what branch contains just be looking at its name. With a hash, that\u0027s not possible.\n\nSome other options: use incremental integer in a format \u0027{prefix}_split_{n}\u0027, or generate a unique name from files",
