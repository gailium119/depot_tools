      "message": "The script also writes some log lines (e.g. `Runing Presumit upload checks on branch abc ...`, `commit check took a long time xxx` ) to stdout during the execution. Therefore, it means the stdout will be a mix of presubmit result json and non-result log lines. So I wrap the result json wither header and footer to  easily and deterministically find where the result json in the output.\n\nI think ideally `presubmit_support.py ... --json-output -` would only output reuslt json in stdout and nothing else unless `-v` is provided. But it would also be fairly hard to mandate this as anyone could just use sys.stdout or print to write to stdout. I\u0027m open for other ideas.",
