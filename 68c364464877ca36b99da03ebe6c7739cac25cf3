      "message": "would you use the config files supported by the formatters?\ne.g., .clang-format-ignore, .rustfmt.toml, pyproject.toml, etc.\n\nUsing the git config is something we are trying to avoid. Ideally, devs should be able to run the format binaries directly. For example, they should be able to run the clang-format executable, bundled in depot_tools, to format CPP files.\n\nAlso, use of git-config for formatting configs also add unnecessary dependencies to the format tools. For example, in CoG workspace, we cannot use the git config.",

      "message": "The feature we want is to avoid formatting any vendored third party code in any cases, regardless of tools. We know currently some third_party directory are excluded case by case, but without this anytime someone adds a third_party dependencies outside common directories they may have to change multiple formatters\u0027 configs.\n\nWe want to enforce a policy that formatting on third_party code is not allowed (since it makes diff between upstream and local code useless) so a consistent way to config this is important.\n\nAlso, I understand git config is not available in CoG. Is there anything prevent git-cl reading from `codereview.settings` in that case?",
