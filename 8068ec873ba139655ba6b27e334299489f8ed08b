      "message": "The logic of the crbug is partially that the only valid entry here is really an autoroll exception filed in the `Third Party \u003e Autoroll Exceptions` component in the chromium tracker. There\u0027s no reason we can\u0027t restrict visibility individually in that component if we need to, but it would be ideal if there was a single place to manage these. Most 3P deps are in chromium instead of chrome-internal and don\u0027t currently distinguish between them when we file metadata bugs.\n\nDo you have an example where you think someone would run into this e.g have a README.chromium file but not be appropriate to file an exception in external component which we could restrict if needed? If yes, then maybe we need a internal component for these exceptions as well?\n\nThe answer to this will probably influence the `Autoroll` with bug as well. We previously documented that the valid values here were exceptions and at a later time, we intended to check these bugs against specific values e.g temporary exception which has filed. Allowing bugs from outside this boundary introduces edge cases here - and in what circumstances would we expect an Autoroll with a bug? Broken autoroller? Would we really validate that here, or by getting metrics out of the roller itself?",
