      "message": "Thanks I think this is fixed. For some context `refs/changes/*` categorized as type hash because it\u0027s not a branch and doesn\u0027t have a remote branch for `gclient` to diff. It will behave exactly as a hash in most of the cases. Otherwise we need to add a dedicated categorization.",
