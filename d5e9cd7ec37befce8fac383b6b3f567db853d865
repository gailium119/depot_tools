      "message": "Yes, but I\u0027ve found that things get very confusing when chains of dependent CLS are in the mix. I can upload them in a bit; the general description is that I have a patch to enable saving/loading the generated splittings to files. This lets people ensure that the real run does the same thing as the dry run, or to tweak a splitting that\u0027s reasonable but not quite right.\n\nIn the longer term, I also want to write a better splitting algorithm. Both changes will change how we get our splittings, so the reviewer-dict datastructure isn\u0027t really appropriate in general.",
