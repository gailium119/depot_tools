      "message": "Certainly open to moving this in other chromium docs if you can link me, but I put it here because all the tools are in the same dir. As for Google Docs, I guess it should be more accessible to chromium devs at large. As an aside, README.gclient.md shows up in google search and (maybe llms? :))",

(FWIW I have been considering adding a manpage here to explain auth as well)\n\n`README.gclient.md` is a readme for the gclient tool, and likewise for `README.git-cl.md`.  I see now that there\u0027s a cheeky `metrics.README.md`.  Who cares about consistency, amirite?\n\nIMO, at the very least, all of the readmes that aren\u0027t readmes for depot_tools tool users should go into a `docs/` or maybe the existing `man/`.\n\nI\u0027m happy to defer the bikeshedding resolution to vadimsh, but please at least make it `README.blah.md` for consistency (and ideally fix the metrics one too).",

I think the idea would be if its file specific it should be file.README.md but if its not file specific then README.file.md might be better. You basically want the readme to show up near the file.",
