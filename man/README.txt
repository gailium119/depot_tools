= Man pages for Depot_tools

This document describes how to write documentation for depot_tools and how to
deploy it.

== Edit

Only edit files in src/ directories. All other directories (e.g. html, man1) are
autogenerated and should never be edited manaully.

Once you made modifications to src/ files, run  `./make_docs.sh` in src/
directory to generate html and man pages.

== Deploy

This is fully automated. After you submit your CL, the tutorial will be deployed
within 24 hours. See [https://ci.chromium.org/ui/p/infra-internal/builders/prod/depot_tools%20zip%20uploader].
