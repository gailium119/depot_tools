depot_tools_gerrit_auth(7)
==========================

NAME
----
depot_tools_gerrit_auth - Gerrit authentication for depot_tools

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The Chromium linkgit:depot_tools[7] suite contains many tools which
may need to authenticate to Gerrit.

Gerrit uses OAuth for authentication.  Usually, the OAuth is handled
by git-credential-luci.  You need to login once with
git-credential-luci, and then it will provide access tokens for Gerrit
authentication.

depot_tools uses git-credential-luci to authenticate Gerrit API calls.

GIT CONFIGURATION
-----------------

You need to configure Git to authenticate to Gerrit.  While
depot_tools can help set up the necessary configuration, you can do it
manually.

You need to add the following lines to your Git config:

[subs="quotes"]
----
[credential "https://chromium.googlesource.com"]
helper =
helper = luci
----

The empty value is needed to reset the helper list to prevent
conflicts.  You should copy this for each Gerrit host you need.

For Googlers, see go/chrome-gerrit-auth.
