# Copyright 2024 The Chromium Authors. All rights reserved.
# Use of this source code is governed by a BSD-style license that can be
# found in the LICENSE file.

# These licenses are used to verify that code imported to Android complies with
# their licensing requirements. Do not add entries to this list without approval.
# SPDX Identifiers are preferred when available. For the full list of
# identifiers; see https://spdx.org/licenses/.
# Licenses are grouped by their classification (restrictiveness level) and then alphabetically.
#
# The classifications are based on the license classifier tool available at:
# https://github.com/google/licenseclassifier/blob/main/license_type.go
# Unfortunately, this open source version is no longer maintained.
# These are the differrent classifications we identify, ordered by restrictiveness level:
# * unencumbered, permissive, notice, reciprocal, restricted, by_exception_only, forbidden.
#
# 'by_exception_only' and 'forbidden' should never enter Chromium, reach out to
# product counsel if the need arises.
#
# REVIEW INSTRUCTIONS FOR chromium-third-party@google.com (and a guide to contributing to this file):
# 1. Paste the contents of the license to be classified into
#   https://opensource.corp.google.com/license/analyze. This will provide the ID
#   and the classification. Command line alternatives are documented at
#   go/license-classifier, but work on entire files only.
#   1.1 'unencumbered', 'permissive', or 'notice' are allowed âœ….
#   1.2 'reciprocal' are allowed, but only in open source projects e.g. Chromium.
#       See OPEN_SOURCE_SPDX_LICENSES below.
#   1.3 >='restricted' are handled on a case-by-case basis and require individual approval
#       from opensource-licensing@google.com and chromium-third-party@google.com. Be sure to include
#       the license and relevant details in the email. It can be helpful to
#       identify existing dependencies that have already been approved.
#
# 2. Check spdx.org/licenses to see if the license has an SPDX identifier.
#   2.1 If it does: Use this value instead of the license classifier output,
#       and add it to ALLOWED_SPDX_LICENSES.
#   2.2 If does not: Add the id provided by the license classifier
#       to EXTENDED_LICENSE_CLASSIFIERS.
#
# 3. Ensure that it is added under the correct classification
#   e.g. '# notice', and then sorted alphabetically asscending.
#
# 4. If you are uncertain whether a given third-party library can be included in
#   Chromium, please email opensource-licensing@google.com with the library's
#   license documentation, and explain where and how the component is going to
#   be used.
