# CLs in this file must have the following format:
# A 'Reviewers: [...]' line, where '...' is a (possibly empty) list of reviewer emails.
# A 'Description: ...' line, where '...' is any string (by default, the list of directories the files have been pulled from).
# One or more file lines, consisting of an <action>, <file> pair, in the format output by `git status`.

# Each 'Reviewers' line begins a new CL.
# To use the splitting in this file, use the --from-file option.
